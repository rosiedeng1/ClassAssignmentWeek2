Portfolio Week 2 
## Description

The purpose of this project was to create my own portfolio that gives details about myself and projects I've worked on so potential employers/anyone can look at. I built this project to have a website that showcases my skills and give people access to my contact info if they would like to reach out/are interested. It solves the problem of creating a space to showcase my work. I learned a lot about how to create a website from scratch which includes using flexboxes, media queries, and structuring a website properly. 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Usage

This website can be used by clicking on one of the links at the top (About Me, Work, Contact Me, etc ) which goes to the corresponding section and gives details on that topic that is linked. In the Work section, if you click on an image, it will link to a corresponding project that I have worked on. If you resize the webpage, you can see that there is a responsive layout where the content adjusts to webpage. 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
